I broke into software through the back window. Turns out they leave it cracked open a bit.

Being that I learned everything I know about software engineering and computer science on the job, on my own time building projects, reading books, and [applying what I've learned about learning](https://www.dashdashforce.dev/posts/on-learning), there's a certain degree of imposter syndrome that comes with it. My Knuth algorithms book feels bootleg. To remediate this I finally got my first real certification in a programming / software technology and I am now SnowPro Core certified. Snowflake even gave me a nifty link to view it that can be [seen here](https://achieve.snowflake.com/7ddcad86-5a2e-4386-8e78-5babff185ec5#acc.a1FsCvZ0) on their website.

Yes Energy uses Snowflake pretty considerably, to the point [we were named](https://cbs4indy.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/717637001/yes-energy-named-snowflake-manufacturing-and-industrials-data-cloud-product-partner-of-the-year/) an official partner of the year. The on the job experience helped but the test was still surprisingly hard and was well worth the study time.

It feels timely to be able to pass exams on my own with no computer assistance whatsoever, just me and my caffeine addled brain and 100 detailed questions. In an era where AI assistance is becoming so prolific and people are finding [new and creative ways](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/09/google-ai-interview-coder-cheat.html) to cheat on interviews with it, I wonder if we may soon circle back to an era of interviews being an "in person only" style affair for tech jobs, thus making certs earned through accredited processes a little more valuable. At a minimum the exam prep was a very effective, directed, thorough way to comb through the docs and really make sure I understood the ins and outs of how Snowflake really works.

RBAC charts are going to haunt my dreams for a while though.
