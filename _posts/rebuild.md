So I burned everything down and rebuilt it. I was in a mood, what can I say?

Welcome to dashdashforce 2.0. My old blog used a blog template system called Jekyll that used Ruby to power its backend rendering and content serving system and was deployed with GitHub Pages. It worked rather well for what it was but I wasn't interested in learning about Ruby or fixing its various outdated libraries.

As a result I archived the old repo found [here](https://github.com/RM-Terrell/RM-Terrell.github.io) and rebuilt a new blog using the Vercel NextJS blog generator as the base for the blogs backend and Vercel as the hosting system. I'm impressed. Deployments are as easy as merging to `main`, and for local dev I got the whole thing running in a Docker devcontainer which is a big improvement over the fact that I never once ran the old blog locally. Devcontainers are possibly my favorite programming tech right now. I even made my own logo that I'm _mostly_ happy with.

## Life updates

I moved again and I've continued working at Yes Energy but with more of a focus lately on backend systems using Java, SQL, and very recently a code linting system I built in Rust. Times are exciting in the energy industry. I'm also in the course of making a repo that teaches git fundamentals through a series of markdown docs and interactive code modifications for some of the engineers at Yes who are new to using source control. Rust and git posts to come soon.

Still haven't been replaced by an AI so thats nice.
